## About The Project

Welcome to my blog! Here, I have put together reviews and articles on free programming books and tools. It's designed to help programmers and tech enthusiasts find great resources at no cost. You'll find direct links to dive deeper into any topic that interests you.

This project is part of Project Exam 1, a five-week assignment. I have built the front-end using CSS, HTML, and Vanilla JavaScript, with WordPress serving as a headless CMS.
