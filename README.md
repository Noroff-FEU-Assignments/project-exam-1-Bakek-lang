# Code Corner Blog

Welcome to Code Corner! This is a special place I've made for anyone who loves programming and tech stuff. At Code Corner, you can read reviews and articles about free programming books and tools. It's all about helping you find awesome resources without spending any money.
The purpose of this project was to apply the skills I've learned in my first year of studies. It's for Project Exam 1, an exam that lasted 5 weeks.

## Why I Made it

I created Code Corner because I know how hard it can be to find good programming resources that are free. I wanted to make a place where anyone can come to get information and links to dive deeper into programming topics they care about.
