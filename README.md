## About The Project

Welcome to my blog! Here, I have put together reviews and articles on free programming books and tools. It's designed to help programmers and tech enthusiasts find great resources at no cost. You'll find direct links to dive deeper into any topic that interests you.

The purpose of this project was to apply the skills I've learned in my first year. It's for Project Exam 1, an exam that lasted 5 weeks. I developed the front-end using CSS, HTML, and Vanilla JavaScript, with WordPress as a headless CMS for managing content.
